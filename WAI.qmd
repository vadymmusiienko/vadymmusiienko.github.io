### Introduction

This analysis explores the Wideband Acoustic Immittance (WAI) Database hosted by Smith College. The database contains measurements of acoustic properties in human ears, including absorbance, power reflectance, impedance, and other related quantities. Implemented in MySQL, this online database serves as a repository for normative adult WAI measures, facilitating data sharing and analysis across different research studies. The database is publicly accessible [here](http://www.science.smith.edu/wai-database/).

The analysis has two primary objectives:

1. Reproduce Figure 1 from Voss (2020), which illustrates mean absorbances across various studies
2. Visualize WAI mean absorbance across various studies for male and female participats.

#### Load Necessary Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dbplyr)
library(RMariaDB)
```

#### Connect to the database

```{r}
con_wai <- dbConnect(
  MariaDB(), host = "scidb.smith.edu",
  user = "waiuser", password = "smith_waiDB", 
  dbname = "wai"
)
```

### Data exploration

#### Data base structure
```{sql}
#| connection: con_wai

SHOW TABLES;
```

The WAI database consists of 7 tables, but our analysis will focus on the three
most relevant and up-to-date tables: Measurements, PI_Info, and Subjects.

#### Measurements table

```{sql}
#| connection: con_wai

SELECT *
FROM Measurements
LIMIT 0, 5;
```

The Measurements table contains the core data of our analysis, including
publication identifiers, instrument information, and most importantly, frequency
and absorbance measurements. This table links to PI_Info through the Identifier 
column and to Subjects through the SubjectNumber column.

#### PI_Info table
```{sql}
#| connection: con_wai

SELECT Identifier, Year, Authors, AuthorsShortList
FROM PI_Info 
LIMIT 0, 5;
```
The PI_Info table provides metadata about each publication, including author
information and publication year.

#### Subjects table
```{sql}
#| connection: con_wai

SELECT *
FROM Subjects
LIMIT 0, 5;
```

The Subjects table contains demographic information about study participants, 
including ethnicity, sex, and other relevant characteristics.


### Part 1: Reproducing Voss (2020) Figure 1

To recreate Figure 1 from 
[Voss (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7093226/),
we first need to identify the 
publications included in the original figure. Let's examine the available
identifiers in the database.

#### Unique identifiers
```{sql}
#| connection: con_wai

SELECT DISTINCT(Identifier) FROM Measurements;
```

After reviewing the list of Identifiers, I identified the following publications
used in Voss (2020): Abur_2014, Feeney_2017, Groon_2015, Lewis_2015, Liu_2008,
Rosowski_2012, Shahnaz_2006, Shaver_2013, Sun_2016, Voss_1994, Voss_2010,and Werner_2010.

#### Data acquisition

To recreate the figure, we need to calculate average absorbance values across
frequencies for each publication. The legend requires additional publication
information retrieved from the PI_Info table.

Query:

```{sql}
#| connection: con_wai
#| output.var: "figure_data"

SELECT 
    Frequency,
    AVG(Absorbance) AS Mean_absorbance,
    CONCAT(pi.AuthorsShortList, ' (', pi.Year, ') N=', 
    COUNT(DISTINCT SubjectNumber, Ear), ': ', m.Instrument) AS Publication
FROM Measurements AS m
JOIN PI_Info AS pi ON m.Identifier = pi.Identifier
WHERE m.Identifier IN 
  ("Abur_2014", "Feeney_2017", "Groon_2015", "Lewis_2015", "Liu_2008",
  "Rosowski_2012", "Shahnaz_2006", "Shaver_2013", "Sun_2016",
  "Voss_1994", "Voss_2010", "Werner_2010")
GROUP BY Frequency, m.Identifier, pi.Year, m.Instrument
```


#### Custom theme

We designed a custom theme for the plot to align with the style of the original figure.


```{r}
custom_theme <- theme(
  # Background
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "grey"),
  panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "gray80"), 
  
  # Axis text and titles
  axis.text = element_text(size = 8),
  axis.title = element_text(size = 11, colour = "black"),
  
  # Legend
  legend.position = c(0, 1),
  legend.justification = c(0, 1),
  legend.key.size = unit(0.4, "cm"),
  legend.text = element_text(size = 9),
  legend.key = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"),
  legend.background = element_rect(
    fill = "white",
    color = "grey",
    size = 0.5
  ),
  
  # Title
  plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, face = "bold"),
  
  # Ticks on x and y axis
  axis.ticks = element_line(color = "grey", size = 0.5),
  axis.ticks.length = unit(0.2, "cm")
)
```

#### Recreate Figure 1 from Voss (2020)

Here is the code for the final visualization:

```{r}
#| fig-height: 7
#| fig-width: 7

figure_data |> 
  ggplot(
  aes(Frequency, Mean_absorbance, color = Publication)
  ) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  
  # Zoom in on the interval of interest
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(200, 8000), ylim = c(0, 1)) +
  
  # Add custom ticks on x-axis
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000),
    trans = "pseudo_log"
                 ) +
  
  # Add custom ticks on y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1),
                 ) +
  
  # Add the labels
  labs(
    title = "Mean absorbance from each population in WAI database",
    x = "Frequency (Hz)",
    y = "Mean absorbance",
    color = NULL
  ) + 
  
  # Apply the custom theme
  custom_theme

```
Voss (2020) describes the figure as follows:

"Mean absorbances for the 12 studies within the WAI database as of July 1, 2019. The legend includes peer-reviewed publications, the number of individual ears, and the equipment used in the studies. For ears with multiple measurements, the average was used. The figure includes all ears in the database, without controlling for the number of ears from each subject."


### Analyze mean absorbance for male and female

#### Data acquisition

This analysis aims to determine whether there is a difference in mean absorbance
between male and female participants. As in the previous analysis, we use the 
same set of publications. Participant sex information is retrieved from the 
Subjects table, which is joined with the Measurements table to link absorbance 
data with demographic details.

Query:

```{sql}
#| connection: con_wai
#| output.var: "wai_sex"

SELECT 
    Frequency,
    CASE 
      WHEN UPPER(Sex) LIKE '%MALE%' THEN 'Male'
      WHEN UPPER(Sex) LIKE '%FEMA%' THEN 'Female'
    END AS Sex,
    AVG(Absorbance) AS Mean_absorbance,
    CONCAT(Sex, ' N=', 
    COUNT(DISTINCT m.SubjectNumber, Ear), ': ', m.Identifier) AS Label
FROM Measurements AS m
JOIN Subjects AS s ON m.SubjectNumber = s.SubjectNumber
WHERE m.Identifier IN ("Abur_2014", "Feeney_2017", "Groon_2015", "Lewis_2015", "Liu_2008", "Rosowski_2012", "Shahnaz_2006", "Shaver_2013", "Sun_2016", "Voss_1994", "Voss_2010", "Werner_2010") 
AND Sex != 'Unknown'
GROUP BY Frequency, s.Sex, m.Identifier
```


#### Visualization

The following R code generates the visualization to compare mean absorbance between male and female participants:

```{r}
# Graph the data
wai_sex |>
  ggplot(
  aes(Frequency, Mean_absorbance, group = Label, color = Sex)
  ) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  
  # Zoom in on the interval of interest
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(200, 8000), ylim = c(0, 1)) +
  
  # Add custom ticks on x-axis
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 2000, 4000, 6000, 8000),
    trans = "pseudo_log"
                 ) +
  
  # Add custom ticks on y-axis
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1),
                 ) +
  
  # Add the labels
  labs(
    title = "Mean absorbance for male and female",
    x = "Frequency (Hz)",
    y = "Mean absorbance",
    color = NULL
  ) + 
  
  # Apply the custom theme
  custom_theme
```

This plot reveals that female participants exhibit higher absorbance than males around the 800 Hz frequency range. However, the difference diminishes below 800 Hz and beyond 5000 Hz, where absorbance levels for both sexes are nearly identical.

Additionally, I will be analyzing the price and rating (points) of the wine, so I want to remove any rows where these variables contain missing (NA) values. Finally, my analysis will not include regions and wineries, so I will exclude those columns.\n\n# Clean up the data\nwine_data &lt;- wine_data |&gt; filter(!(is.na(price) | is.na(country))) |&gt;\n  mutate(country = as.factor(country)) |&gt;\n  select(-c(region_1, region_2, winery))\n\n\n\nAnalisys\n\nAverage price by country\nOne of the first interesting insights would be to determine which countries produce the most expensive and the cheapest wines. To find this out, let’s create a plot showing the average wine prices for each country in the dataset.\n\nwine_data |&gt; \n  group_by(country) |&gt;\n  summarize(avr_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(country, avr_price, .desc = TRUE), avr_price,\n             fill = country)) +\n  geom_col(color = \"black\", width = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average price of wine\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = \"Price in USD\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe countries that produce the most expensive wines are the US, France, England, Hungary, and Luxembourg, with average prices ranging from 40 to 50 USD. On the other hand, the cheapest wine producers are Montenegro, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Bosnia, and Ukraine, where wines typically cost between 10 and 15 USD.\n\n\nCorrelation between Price and Quality\nAnother interesting question to explore is the correlation between price and quality. Are more expensive wines actually better than cheaper ones? To find out, let’s visualize the relationship between prices and ratings (points).\n\nwine_data |&gt;\n  filter(price &lt; 500) |&gt;\n  group_by(price) |&gt;\n  summarize(avr_rating = mean(points)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(price, avr_rating)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_smooth(color = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Price vs. Quality\",\n    x = \"Price (USD)\",\n    y = \"Average rating (Points)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is definitely a correlation between price and rating, with more expensive wines tending to have higher ratings. However, the relationship is stronger in the 0 to 100 USD range, where price significantly impacts quality. Beyond 100 USD, wines are fairly similar in quality, with higher prices offering only a slight improvement.\n\n\nFlavor notes affect on price and quality\nWine can have a wide variety of flavors, described using different flavor notes. To determine which flavor notes are the most desirable, I identified 24 of the most commonly used adjectives to describe wine flavors. You can find the article with this information here.\nFirst, let’s see if these adjectives are actually used in the wine reviews and which ones are more common than others. We’ll plot the frequency of each adjective mentioned in the description section of the reviews.\n\n# Create a vector with the adjectives\nadjectives &lt;- c(\"Acidic\", \"Astringent\", \"Barnyard\", \"Buttery\", \"Chewy\",\n                \"Earthy\", \"Flabby\", \"Fruity\", \"Fruit-forward\",\n                \"Herbaceous\", \"Jammy\", \"Juicy\", \"Musty\", \"Nutty\",\n                \"Oaky\", \"Opulent\", \"Perfumed\", \"Racy\", \"Spicy\",\n                \"Supple\", \"Tannic\", \"Toasty\", \"Vegetal\", \"Velvety\")\n\n# Create a regex pattern to search for adjectives\npattern &lt;- paste0(\"(?i)\", paste(adjectives, collapse = \"|\"))\n\n# Create a data frame with wine reviews where those adjectives were used\nwine_with_adj &lt;- wine_data |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    adjective = factor(tolower(str_extract(description, pattern)))\n    ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(adjective))\n\n# Plot the frequency of each adjective\nwine_with_adj |&gt; group_by(adjective) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(count, fct_reorder(adjective, count, .desc = TRUE), \n             fill = adjective)) +\n  geom_col(color = \"black\", width = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Adjective Frequency in Wine Reviews\",\n    y = NULL,\n    x = \"Number of times mentioned\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that most of these adjectives are widely used among wine experts. “Fruity,” “Spicy,” “Tannic,” and “Juicy” appear in over 5,000 reviews, making them very common. On the other hand, adjectives like “Musty,” “Flabby,” and “Fruit-forward” are relatively rare.\nNow that we know wine experts frequently use these words, let’s explore which flavor notes are associated with more sophisticated wines. To visualize this, we’ll plot the average price and rating for each adjective.\n\n# Plot average price and rating depending on a flavor note\nwine_with_adj |&gt; group_by(adjective) |&gt;\n  summarise(avr_price = mean(price), avr_points = mean(points)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(avr_price, avr_points)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = adjective),\n                   size = 2.5, color = \"black\", fill = \"lightyellow\", \n                   label.size = 0.25, label.padding = 0.25, \n                   box.padding = 0.25) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Price and Rating of Wine by Flavor Note\",\n    x = \"Average Price (USD)\",\n    y = \"Average Points (Points)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clear winner among the flavor notes is “opulent,” which is often associated with the most sophisticated wines. Opulent wines not only have the highest prices but also receive the best ratings. Close contenders are “velvety” and “astringent.” Both velvety and astringent wines are also quite expensive, with velvety wines having higher ratings. In contrast, the cheapest and lowest-quality wines are described as “musty,” “flabby,” and “vegetal.”\n\n\nBerry notes\nWhile reviewing the descriptions, I noticed that wine is often described as having various berry flavor notes. Let’s conduct a similar analysis to determine which berry flavor is considered the most “expensive.”\nThe regular expression I used for matching berries is: (?i)\\b\\w+erry\\b.\n\n# A data frame with wines that were described with some berry\nberries &lt;- wine_data |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(description, \"(?i)\\\\b\\\\w+erry\\\\b\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(berry = tolower(str_extract(description, \"(?i)\\\\b\\\\w+erry\\\\b\")))\n\n# The 6 most used berries used to describe wine (except for just \"berry\")\ntopberries &lt;- berries |&gt; group_by(berry) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n()) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(count)) |&gt;\n  filter(berry != \"berry\") |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 6)\n\n# Plot the price of wine with different berry notes\nberries |&gt; \n  filter(berry %in% topberries$berry) |&gt;\n  group_by(berry)|&gt;\n  summarize(avr_price = mean(price)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(berry, avr_price, .desc = TRUE), avr_price,\n             fill = berry)) +\n  geom_col(color = \"black\", show.legend = FALSE) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(25, 45)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Price of Wine with Different Berry Notes\",\n    y = \"Average price (USD)\",\n    x = NULL\n  ) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = berry), color = \"black\", \n            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.9),\n            size = 3.5,\n            alpha = 0.8) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWines with blackberry flavor tend to be the most expensive, with an average price of around $42. In contrast, strawberry-flavored wines are the cheapest, averaging $32."

    "text": "This bar chart displays the top 5 countries hosting the most Ukrainian refugees (since the beginning of the full-scale invasion).The y-axis represents the total number of refugees, with Russia hosting the highest number, exceeding a million. Germany and Poland follow closely with almost a million refugees each, while the Czech Republic has just under 500,000. The UK has the fewest refugees among the five countries, with less than 250,000.\nKey observations:\nThe significant difference in the number of Ukrainian refugees in Russia compared to other countries is striking, prompting the question: why are people fleeing the war to the very aggressor? This is primarily because Russian forces in occupied Ukrainian territories forcibly deporting people to Russia, labeling them as “refugees” and leaving them with no other option. In contrast, Poland and Germany are popular destinations for Ukrainian refugees, likely due to their proximity and strong support."

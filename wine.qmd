### Import Libraries and Data

The tidyverse package is used for data visualization, while ggrepel adds
functionality for labeling text on plots.

```{r}
# Load the libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

# Load the data
wine_data <- read_csv("data/winemag-data_first150k.csv")
```

### Inspect the Dataset

Let's take a look at the first 10 records.

```{r}
slice_head(wine_data, n = 10)
```

### Clean the Data:

From inspecting the dataset, it appears that the country variable is of
type <chr>, but I want it to be <fct> (a factor) so that it can be
ordered. Additionally, I will be analyzing the price and rating (points)
of the wine, so I want to remove any rows where these variables contain
missing (NA) values. Finally, my analysis will not include regions and
wineries, so I will exclude those columns.

```{r}
# Clean up the data
wine_data <- wine_data |> filter(!(is.na(price) | is.na(country))) |>
  mutate(country = as.factor(country)) |>
  select(-c(region_1, region_2, winery))
```

### Analisys

#### Average price by country

One of the first interesting insights would be to determine which
countries produce the most expensive and the cheapest wines. To find
this out, let's create a plot showing the average wine prices for each
country in the dataset.

```{r}
wine_data |> 
  group_by(country) |>
  summarize(avr_price = mean(price)) |>
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(country, avr_price, .desc = TRUE), avr_price,
             fill = country)) +
  geom_col(color = "black", width = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Average price of wine",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Price in USD"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

The countries that produce the most expensive wines are the US, France,
England, Hungary, and Luxembourg, with average prices ranging from 40 to
50 USD. On the other hand, the cheapest wine producers are Montenegro,
Lithuania, Bulgaria, Bosnia, and Ukraine, where wines typically cost
between 10 and 15 USD.

#### Correlation between Price and Quality

Another interesting question to explore is the correlation between price
and quality. Are more expensive wines actually better than cheaper ones?
To find out, let's visualize the relationship between prices and ratings
(points).

```{r}
wine_data |>
  filter(price < 500) |>
  group_by(price) |>
  summarize(avr_rating = mean(points)) |>
  ggplot(aes(price, avr_rating)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Price vs. Quality",
    x = "Price (USD)",
    y = "Average rating (Points)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

There is definitely a correlation between price and rating, with more
expensive wines tending to have higher ratings. However, the
relationship is stronger in the 0 to 100 USD range, where price
significantly impacts quality. Beyond 100 USD, wines are fairly similar
in quality, with higher prices offering only a slight improvement.

#### Flavor notes affect on price and quality

Wine can have a wide variety of flavors, described using different
flavor notes. To determine which flavor notes are the most desirable, I
identified 24 of the most commonly used adjectives to describe wine
flavors. You can find the article with this information
[here](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/wine-descriptions).

First, let's see if these adjectives are actually used in the wine
reviews and which ones are more common than others. We'll plot the
frequency of each adjective mentioned in the description section of the
reviews.

```{r}
# Create a vector with the adjectives
adjectives <- c("Acidic", "Astringent", "Barnyard", "Buttery", "Chewy",
                "Earthy", "Flabby", "Fruity", "Fruit-forward",
                "Herbaceous", "Jammy", "Juicy", "Musty", "Nutty",
                "Oaky", "Opulent", "Perfumed", "Racy", "Spicy",
                "Supple", "Tannic", "Toasty", "Vegetal", "Velvety")

# Create a regex pattern to search for adjectives
pattern <- paste0("(?i)", paste(adjectives, collapse = "|"))

# Create a data frame with wine reviews where those adjectives were used
wine_with_adj <- wine_data |> 
  mutate(
    adjective = factor(tolower(str_extract(description, pattern)))
    ) |>
  filter(!is.na(adjective))

# Plot the frequency of each adjective
wine_with_adj |> group_by(adjective) |>
  summarise(count = n()) |>
  ggplot(aes(count, fct_reorder(adjective, count, .desc = TRUE), 
             fill = adjective)) +
  geom_col(color = "black", width = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Adjective Frequency in Wine Reviews",
    y = NULL,
    x = "Number of times mentioned"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

We can see that most of these adjectives are widely used among wine
experts. "Fruity," "Spicy," "Tannic," and "Juicy" appear in over 5,000
reviews, making them very common. On the other hand, adjectives like
"Musty," "Flabby," and "Fruit-forward" are relatively rare.

Now that we know wine experts frequently use these words, let's explore
which flavor notes are associated with more sophisticated wines. To
visualize this, we'll plot the average price and rating for each
adjective.

```{r}
# Plot average price and rating depending on a flavor note
wine_with_adj |> group_by(adjective) |>
  summarise(avr_price = mean(price), avr_points = mean(points)) |>
  ggplot(aes(avr_price, avr_points)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = adjective),
                   size = 2.5, color = "black", fill = "lightyellow", 
                   label.size = 0.25, label.padding = 0.25, 
                   box.padding = 0.25) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Price and Rating of Wine by Flavor Note",
    x = "Average Price (USD)",
    y = "Average Points (Points)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

The clear winner among the flavor notes is "opulent," which is often
associated with the most sophisticated wines. Opulent wines not only
have the highest prices but also receive the best ratings. Close
contenders are "velvety" and "astringent." Both velvety and astringent
wines are also quite expensive, with velvety wines having higher
ratings. In contrast, the cheapest and lowest-quality wines are
described as "musty," "flabby," and "vegetal."

#### Berry notes

While reviewing the descriptions, I noticed that wine is often described
as having various berry flavor notes. Let's conduct a similar analysis
to determine which berry flavor is considered the most "expensive."

The regular expression I used for matching berries is:
(?i)\\b\\w+erry\\b.

```{r}
# A data frame with wines that were described with some berry
berries <- wine_data |>
  filter(str_detect(description, "(?i)\\b\\w+erry\\b")) |>
  mutate(berry = tolower(str_extract(description, "(?i)\\b\\w+erry\\b")))

# The 6 most used berries used to describe wine (except for just "berry")
topberries <- berries |> group_by(berry) |>
  summarize(count = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count)) |>
  filter(berry != "berry") |>
  slice_head(n = 6)

# Plot the price of wine with different berry notes
berries |> 
  filter(berry %in% topberries$berry) |>
  group_by(berry)|>
  summarize(avr_price = mean(price)) |>
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(berry, avr_price, .desc = TRUE), avr_price,
             fill = berry)) +
  geom_col(color = "black", show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(25, 45)) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Price of Wine with Different Berry Notes",
    y = "Average price (USD)",
    x = NULL
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = berry), color = "black", 
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.9),
            size = 3.5,
            alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())
```

Wines with blackberry flavor tend to be the most expensive, with an
average price of around \$42. In contrast, strawberry-flavored wines are
the cheapest, averaging \$32.
